  abstract = {During motor learning, movements and underlying neural activity initially exhibit large trial-to-trial variability that decreases over learning. However, it is unclear how task-relevant neural populations coordinate to explore and consolidate activity patterns. Exploration and consolidation could happen for each neuron independently, across the population jointly, or both. We disambiguated among these possibilities by investigating how subjects learned de novo to control a brain-machine interface using neurons from motor cortex. We decomposed population activity into the sum of private and shared signals, which produce uncorrelated and correlated neural variance, respectively, and examined how these signals' evolution causally shapes behavior. We found that initially large trial-to-trial movement and private neural variability reduce over learning. Concomitantly, task-relevant shared variance increases, consolidating a manifold containing consistent neural trajectories that generate refined control. These results suggest that motor cortex acquires skillful control by leveraging both independent and coordinated variance to explore and consolidate neural patterns.},

  abstract = {Motor cortex plays a substantial role in driving movement, yet the details underlying this control remain unresolved. We analyzed the extent to which movement-related information could be extracted from single-trial motor cortical activity recorded while monkeys performed center-out reaching. Using information theoretic techniques, we found that single units carry relatively little speed-related information compared with direction-related information. This result is not mitigated at the population level: simultaneously recorded population activity predicted speed with significantly lower accuracy relative to direction predictions. Furthermore, a unit-dropping analysis revealed that speed accuracy would likely remain lower than direction accuracy, even given larger populations. These results suggest that the instantaneous details of single-trial movement speed are difficult to extract using commonly assumed coding schemes. This apparent paucity of speed information takes particular importance in the context of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), which rely on extracting kinematic information from motor cortex. Previous studies have highlighted subjects' difficulties in holding a BMI cursor stable at targets. These studies, along with our finding of relatively little speed information in motor cortex, inspired a speed-dampening Kalman filter (SDKF) that automatically slows the cursor upon detecting changes in decoded movement direction. Effectively, SDKF enhances speed control by using prevalent directional signals, rather than requiring speed to be directly decoded from neural activity. SDKF improved success rates by a factor of 1.7 relative to a standard Kalman filter in a closed-loop BMI task requiring stable stops at targets. BMI systems enabling stable stops will be more effective and user-friendly when translated into clinical applications.},

Here, we leveraged a brain-machine interface (BMI) paradigm in rhesus monkeys and novel statistical analyses of neural population activity to gain insight into moment-by-moment internal model computations. We discovered that a mismatch between subjects' internal models and the actual BMI explains roughly 65\% of movement errors, as well as long-standing deficiencies in BMI speed control. We then used the internal models to characterize how the neural population activity changes during BMI learning. More broadly, this work provides an approach for interpreting neural population activity in the context of how prior beliefs guide the transformation of sensory input to motor output.},

  abstract = {Background
The results from recent brain-machine interface (BMI) studies suggest that it may be more efficient to use simple arbitrary relationships between individual neuron activity and BMI movements than the complex relationship observed between neuron activity and natural movements. This idea is based on the assumption that individual neurons can be conditioned independently regardless of their natural movement association.
Results
We tested this assumption in the parietal reach region (PRR), an important candidate area for BMIs in which neurons encode the target location for reaching movements. Monkeys could learn to elicit arbitrarily assigned activity patterns, but the seemingly arbitrary patterns always belonged to the response set for natural reaching movements. Moreover, neurons that are free from conditioning showed correlated responses with the conditioned neurons as if they encoded common reach targets. Thus, learning was accomplished by finding reach targets (intrinsic variable of PRR neurons) for which the natural response of reach planning could approximate the arbitrary patterns.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that animals learn to volitionally control single-neuron activity in PRR by preferentially exploring and exploiting their natural movement repertoire. Thus, for optimal performance, BMIs utilizing neural signals in PRR should harness, not disregard, the activity patterns in the natural sensorimotor repertoire.},

To understand the importance of learning-related changes in a network of neurons, it is necessary to understand how the network acts as a whole to generate behavior. Here we introduce a paradigm in which the output of a cortical network can be perturbed directly and the neural basis of the compensatory changes studied in detail. Using a brain-computer interface, dozens of simultaneously recorded neurons in the motor cortex of awake, behaving monkeys are used to control the movement of a cursor in a three-dimensional virtual-reality environment. This device creates a precise, well-defined mapping between the firing of the recorded neurons and an expressed behavior (cursor movement). In a series of experiments, we force the animal to relearn the association between neural firing and cursor movement in a subset of neurons and assess how the network changes to compensate. We find that changes in neural activity reflect not only an alteration of behavioral strategy but also the relative contributions of individual neurons to the population error signal.},

  abstract = {Learning often involves adapting behavior in response to the inferred causes of success and failure. At the neural level, this can be the result of repeating activity patterns of neurons that lead to favorable outcomes. However, it is not clear how the contributions of individual cells to an ongoing behavior is assessed. Using a calcium imaging based closed loop Brain-Machine Interface (CaBMI), we trained mice to perform a neuroprosthetic task using the coordinated activity of a small ensemble of neurons in layer 2/3 of sensorimotor cortex. We find that that after an initial period of exploration, neurons that do not directly drive the effector decrease in both variance and event frequency over the course of learning. However, a large fraction of these `indirect' cells demonstrate robust spatiotemporal dynamics both before and after an animal achieves reward. Throughout a single 30 minute session, these spatiotemporal sequences increase in frequency and become more consistent. Our findings suggest that neuroprosthetic control is the result of an emergent, spatially organized network level solution, rather than the direct modulation of a few chosen output neurons.},

  abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces have seen an increase in popularity due to their potential for direct neuroprosthetic applications for amputees and disabled individuals. Supporting this promise, animals\textemdash{}including humans\textemdash{}can learn even arbitrary mapping between the activity of cortical neurons and movement of prosthetic devices [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, the performance of neuroprosthetic device control has been nowhere near that of limb control in healthy individuals, presenting a dire need to improve the performance. One potential limitation is the fact that previous work has not distinguished diverse cell types in the neocortex, even though different cell types possess distinct functions in cortical computations [5, 6, 7] and likely distinct capacities to control brain-computer interfaces. Here, we made a first step in addressing this issue by tracking the plastic changes of three~major types of cortical inhibitory neurons (INs) during a neuron-pair operant conditioning task using two-photon imaging of IN subtypes expressing GCaMP6f. Mice were rewarded when the activity of the positive target neuron (N+) exceeded that of the negative target neuron (N-) beyond a set threshold. Mice improved performance with all subtypes, but the strategies were subtype specific. When parvalbumin (PV)-expressing INs were targeted, the activity of N- decreased. However, targeting of somatostatin (SOM)- and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing INs led to an increase of the N+ activity. These results demonstrate that INs can be individually modulated in a subtype-specific manner and highlight the versatility of neural circuits in adapting to new demands by using cell-type-specific strategies.},

Brain-machine interfaces have used instrumental conditioning to reinforce patterns of neural activity directly, especially in frontal and motor cortices, which are a rich source of signals for voluntary action. However, evidence suggests that activity in primary sensory cortices may also reflect internally driven processes, instead of purely encoding antecedent stimuli. Here, we show that rats and mice can learn to produce arbitrary patterns of neural activity in their primary visual cortex to control an auditory cursor and obtain reward. Furthermore, learning was prevented when neurons in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), which receives input from visual cortex, were optogenetically inhibited, but not during inhibition of nearby neurons in the dorsolateral striatum. After learning, DMS inhibition did not affect production of the rewarded patterns. These data demonstrate that cortico-basal ganglia circuits play a general role in learning to produce cortical activity that leads to desirable outcomes.},

Adaptive decoding methods hold promise for improving neuroprosthetic performance in nonstationary systems. Here, we explore the use of decoder adaptation to shape neuroplasticity in two scenarios relevant for real-world neuroprostheses: nonstationary recordings of neural activity and changes in control context. Nonhuman primates learned to control a cursor to perform a reaching task~using semistationary neural activity in two contexts: with and without simultaneous arm movements. Decoder adaptation was used to improve initial performance and compensate for changes in neural recordings. We show that beneficial neuroplasticity can occur alongside decoder adaptation, yielding performance improvements, skill retention, and resistance to interference from native motor networks. These results highlight the utility of neuroplasticity for real-world neuroprostheses.},

Population imaging in M1 revealed that learning-related activity changes are observed in the conditioned cell only, which highlights the functional potential of individual neurons in the neocortex.

During performance, an error signal emerges representing the difference between what was predicted and what actually happened. Several studies have focused on understanding how error signals emerges. Yet, the predictions needed to compute these error signals are still unclear. It has been suggested that the ventral striatum, may be the responsible for encoding a prediction function. So far, there is no clear evidence that these predictions are present in the ventral striatum or which different roles dorsal and the ventral striatum may be playing during neuroprosthetic control. To that effect, we trained rats to control a brain-machine-interface (BMI) with motor cortex units while recording the activity in striatum. Our results show that neuronal activity of the ventral striatum could predict future outcome and that this prediction coincided with the state prediction of a temporal difference model of reinforcement learning. These results highlight the relevance of the ventral striatum during neuroprosthetic control and point towards the use of neuronal prediction information to improve brain-machine-interfaces.},

While the process of learning and controlling a BMI is complex, involving cortico-striatal networks, it has been well-established that the brain is able to learn to control BMI actuators using relatively few neurons as direct inputs into the decoder. In particular, neurons that are used as inputs to a BMI decoder (direct neurons) experience changes in direction tuning and modulation depth, eventually forming a stable neuroprosthetic map. Furthermore, previous work has shown that indirect neurons (those that are not inputs to the decoder) also form a stable neuroprosthetic map that differs from manual reaching. However, it is still unclear how these changes in indirect units are formed over the course of learning. We found that indirect neurons adapted similarly to that of direct neurons over learning. Indirect neurons formed a stabilized tuning map, decreased neural dimensionality, and consolidated firing activity into more correlated patterns. Furthermore, direct and indirect neurons adapted together, not only coordinating activity within each population, but across populations as well. Together, our results show that indirect neurons change alongside direct neurons, suggesting a large-scale neural search and adaptation for direct neurons.},
