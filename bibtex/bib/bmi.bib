  abstract = {Brain imagination to control external devices Studies in monkeys have implicated the brain's posterior parietal cortex in high-level coding of planned and imagined actions. Aflalo et al. implanted two microelectrode arrays in the posterior parietal cortex of a tetraplegic patient (see the Perspective by Pruszynski and Diedrichsen). They asked the patient to imagine various types of limb or eye movements. As predicted, motor imagery involved the same types of neural population activity involved in actual movements, which could potentially be exploited in prosthetic limb control. Science, this issue p. 906; see also p. 860 Nonhuman primate and human studies have suggested that populations of neurons in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) may represent high-level aspects of action planning that can be used to control external devices as part of a brain-machine interface. However, there is no direct neuron-recording evidence that human PPC is involved in action planning, and the suitability of these signals for neuroprosthetic control has not been tested. We recorded neural population activity with arrays of microelectrodes implanted in the PPC of a tetraplegic subject. Motor imagery could be decoded from these neural populations, including imagined goals, trajectories, and types of movement. These findings indicate that the PPC of humans represents high-level, cognitive aspects of action and that the PPC can be a rich source for cognitive control signals for neural prosthetics that assist paralyzed patients. Neurons in the human posterior parietal cortex encode high-level aspects of imagined movements.

  abstract = {A dramatic example of translational monkey research is the development of neural prosthetics for assisting paralyzed patients. A neuroprosthesis consists of implanted electrodes that can record the intended movement of a paralyzed part of the body, a computer algorithm that decodes the intended movement, and an assistive device such as a robot limb or computer that is controlled by these intended movement signals. This type of neuroprosthetic system is also referred to as a brain\textendash machine interface (BMI) since it interfaces the brain with an external machine. In this review, we will concentrate on BMIs in which microelectrode recording arrays are implanted in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a high-level cortical area in both humans and monkeys that represents intentions to move. This review will first discuss the basic science research performed in healthy monkeys that established PPC as a good source of intention signals. Next, it will describe the first PPC implants in human patients with tetraplegia from spinal cord injury. From these patients the goals of movements could be quickly decoded, and the rich number of action variables found in PPC indicates that it is an appropriate BMI site for a very wide range of neuroprosthetic applications. We will discuss research on learning to use BMIs in monkeys and humans and the advances that are still needed, requiring both monkey and human research to enable BMIs to be readily available in the clinic.},

However, it is unclear how task-relevant neural populations coordinate to explore and consolidate activity patterns. Exploration and consolidation could happen for each neuron independently, across the population jointly, or both. We disambiguated among these possibilities by investigating how subjects learned de novo to control a brain-machine interface using neurons from motor cortex. We decomposed population activity into the sum of private and shared signals, which produce uncorrelated and correlated neural variance, respectively, and examined how these signals' evolution causally shapes behavior. We found that initially large trial-to-trial movement and private neural variability reduce over learning. Concomitantly, task-relevant shared variance increases, consolidating a manifold containing consistent neural trajectories that generate refined control. These results suggest that motor cortex acquires skillful control by leveraging both independent and coordinated variance to explore and consolidate neural patterns.},

Dopamine-dependent cortico-striatal plasticity provides a framework for learning behavior's value, but it is less clear how it enables the brain to re-enter desired behaviors and refine them over time. Reinforcing behavior is achieved by re-entering and refining the neural patterns that produce it. We review studies using brain-machine interfaces which reveal that reinforcing cortical population activity requires cortico-basal ganglia circuits. Then, we propose a formal framework for how reinforcement in cortico-basal ganglia circuits acts on the neural dynamics of cortical populations. We propose two parallel mechanisms: i) fast reinforcement which selects the inputs that permit the re-entrance of the particular cortical population dynamics which naturally produced the desired behavior, and ii) slower reinforcement which leads to refinement of cortical population dynamics and more reliable production of neural trajectories driving skillful behavior on-demand.},

Here we demonstrate that primates can learn to reach and grasp virtual objects by controlling a robot arm through a closed-loop brain\textendash machine interface (BMIc) that uses multiple mathematical models to extract several motor parameters (i.e., hand position, velocity, gripping force, and the EMGs of multiple arm muscles) from the electrical activity of frontoparietal neuronal ensembles. As single neurons typically contribute to the encoding of several motor parameters, we observed that high BMIc accuracy required recording from large neuronal ensembles. Continuous BMIc operation by monkeys led to significant improvements in both model predictions and behavioral performance. Using visual feedback, monkeys succeeded in producing robot reach-and-grasp movements even when their arms did not move. Learning to operate the BMIc was paralleled by functional reorganization in multiple cortical areas, suggesting that the dynamic properties of the BMIc were incorporated into motor and sensory cortical representations.},

This motor neural prosthetic technology has spurred an increased interest in the algorithms by which motor intention can be inferred. The simplest of these algorithms is the population vector algorithm (PVA), where the activity of each cell is used to weight a vector pointing in that neuron's preferred direction. Off-line, it is possible to show that more complicated algorithms, such as the optimal linear estimator (OLE), can yield substantial improvements in the accuracy of reconstructed hand movements over the PVA. We call this open-loop performance. In contrast, this performance difference may not be present in closed-loop, on-line control. The obvious difference between open and closed-loop control is the ability to adapt to the specifics of the decoder in use at the time. In order to predict performance gains that an algorithm may yield in closed-loop control, it is necessary to build a model that captures aspects of this adaptation process. Here we present a framework for modeling the closed-loop performance of the PVA and the OLE. Using both simulations and experiments, we show that (1) the performance gain with certain decoders can be far less extreme than predicted by off-line results, (2) that subjects are able to compensate for certain types of bias in decoders, and (3) that care must be taken to ensure that estimation error does not degrade the performance of theoretically optimal decoders.},

  abstract = {Typically, tuning curves in motor cortex are constructed by fitting the firing rate of a neuron as a function of some observed action, such as arm direction or movement speed. These tuning curves are then often interpreted causally as representing the firing rate as a function of the desired movement, or intent. This interpretation implicitly assumes that the motor command and the motor act are equivalent. However, any kind of perturbation, be it external, such as a visuomotor rotation, or internal, such as muscle fatigue, can create a difference between the motor intent and the action. How do we estimate the tuning curve under these conditions? Furthermore, it is well known that, during learning or adaptation, the relationship between neural firing and the observed movement can change. Does this change indicate a change in the inputs to the population, or a change in the way those inputs are processed? In this work, we present a method to infer the latent, unobserved inputs into the population of recorded neurons. Using data from nonhuman primates performing brain\textendash computer interface experiments, we show that tuning curves based on these latent directions fit better than tuning curves based on actual movements. Finally, using data from a brain\textendash computer interface learning experiment in which half of the units were decoded incorrectly, we demonstrate how this method might differentiate various aspects of motor adaptation.},

  abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a defined link between neural activity and devices, allowing a detailed study of the neural adaptive responses generating behavioral output. We trained monkeys to perform two-dimensional center-out movements of a computer cursor using a BCI. We then applied a perturbation by randomly selecting a subset of the recorded units and rotating their directional contributions to cursor movement by a consistent angle. Globally, this perturbation mimics a visuomotor transformation, and in the first part of this article we characterize the psychophysical indications of motor adaptation and compare them with known results from adaptation of natural reaching movements. Locally, however, only a subset of the neurons in the population actually contributes to error, allowing us to probe for signatures of neural adaptation that might be specific to the subset of neurons we perturbed. One compensation strategy would be to selectively adapt the subset of cells responsible for the error. An alternate strategy would be to globally adapt the entire population to correct the error. Using a recently developed mathematical technique that allows us to differentiate these two mechanisms, we found evidence of both strategies in the neural responses. The dominant strategy we observed was global, accounting for {$\sim$}86\% of the total error reduction. The remaining 14\% came from local changes in the tuning functions of the perturbed units. Interestingly, these local changes were specific to the details of the applied rotation: in particular, changes in the depth of tuning were only observed when the percentage of perturbed cells was small. These results imply that there may be constraints on the network's adaptive capabilities, at least for perturbations lasting only a few hundreds of trials.}

How such control is represented at the sensory level, however, is not understood. Here we devised a brain machine interface (BMI) task that enabled mice to guide a visual cursor to a target location for reward, using activity in brain areas recorded with widefield calcium imaging. Parietal and higher visual cortical regions were more engaged when expert animals controlled the cursor, but not in na\"ive mice learning the task. Intentional control enhanced responses: single-cell recordings from parietal cortex indicated that the same visual cursor elicited larger responses when mice controlled it than when they passively viewed it. Moreover, neural responses were greater when the cursor was moving towards the target than away from it. Thus, the sensory representation of a causally-controlled object is sensitive to a subject's intention, as well as the object's instantaneous trajectory relative to the subject's goal: potentially strengthening the sensory feedback signal to adjudicating areas for exerting more fluent control.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The Riemannian framework is sharp from a mathematical perspective, yet in practice it is simple, both algorithmically and computationally. This allows the conception of online decoding machines suiting real-world operation in adverse conditions. We provide here a review on the use of Riemannian geometry for BCI and a primer on the classification frameworks based on it. While the theoretical research on Riemannian geometry is technical, our aim here is to show the appeal of the framework on an intuitive geometrical ground. In particular, we provide a rationale for its robustness and transfer learning capabilities and we elucidate the link between a simple Riemannian classifier and a state-of-the-art spatial filtering approach. We conclude by reporting details on the construction of data points to be manipulated in the Riemannian framework in the context of BCI and by providing links to available open-source Matlab and Python code libraries for designing BCI decoders.},

In this study, we examine how the brain harnesses neuronal patterns that correspond to the current action-perception state during learning. To this end, we recorded activity from motor cortex while monkeys either performed a familiar motor task (movement-state) or learned to control the firing rate of a target neuron using a brain-machine interface (BMI-state). Before learning, monkeys were placed in an observation-state, where no action was required. We found that neuronal patterns during the BMI-state were markedly different from the movement-state patterns. BMI-state patterns were initially similar to those in the observation-state and evolved to produce an increase in the firing rate of the target neuron. The overall activity of the non-target neurons remained similar after learning, suggesting that excitatory-inhibitory balance was maintained. Indeed, a novel neural-level reinforcement-learning network model operating in a chaotic regime of balanced excitation and inhibition predicts our results in detail. We conclude that during BMI learning, the brain can adapt patterns corresponding to the current action-perception state to gain rewards. Moreover, our results show that we can predict activity changes that occur during learning based on the pre-learning activity. This new finding may serve as a key step toward clinical brain-machine interface applications to modify impaired brain activity.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Some evidence comes from conventional experiments that reveal volitional modulation in neural activity related to behaviours, including real and imagined movements, cognitive imagery and shifts of attention. More direct evidence comes from studies on operant conditioning of neural activity using biofeedback, and from BCI/BMI studies in which neural activity controls cursors or peripheral devices. Limits in the degree of accuracy of control in the latter studies can be attributed to several possible factors. Some of these factors, particularly limited practice time, can be addressed with long-term implanted BCIs. Preliminary observations with implanted circuits implementing recurrent BCIs are summarized.},

We analyzed the extent to which movement-related information could be extracted from single-trial motor cortical activity recorded while monkeys performed center-out reaching. Using information theoretic techniques, we found that single units carry relatively little speed-related information compared with direction-related information. This result is not mitigated at the population level: simultaneously recorded population activity predicted speed with significantly lower accuracy relative to direction predictions. Furthermore, a unit-dropping analysis revealed that speed accuracy would likely remain lower than direction accuracy, even given larger populations. These results suggest that the instantaneous details of single-trial movement speed are difficult to extract using commonly assumed coding schemes. This apparent paucity of speed information takes particular importance in the context of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), which rely on extracting kinematic information from motor cortex. Previous studies have highlighted subjects' difficulties in holding a BMI cursor stable at targets. These studies, along with our finding of relatively little speed information in motor cortex, inspired a speed-dampening Kalman filter (SDKF) that automatically slows the cursor upon detecting changes in decoded movement direction. Effectively, SDKF enhances speed control by using prevalent directional signals, rather than requiring speed to be directly decoded from neural activity. SDKF improved success rates by a factor of 1.7 relative to a standard Kalman filter in a closed-loop BMI task requiring stable stops at targets. BMI systems enabling stable stops will be more effective and user-friendly when translated into clinical applications.}

We discovered that a mismatch between subjects' internal models and the actual BMI explains roughly 65\% of movement errors, as well as long-standing deficiencies in BMI speed control. We then used the internal models to characterize how the neural population activity changes during BMI learning. More broadly, this work provides an approach for interpreting neural population activity in the context of how prior beliefs guide the transformation of sensory input to motor output.},

Studies have suggested that these redundant (i.e. behaviorally equivalent) activity patterns may be beneficial for neural computation. However, it is unknown what constraints may limit the selection of different redundant activity patterns. We leveraged a brain-computer interface, allowing us to define precisely which neural activity patterns were redundant. Rhesus monkeys made cursor movements by modulating neural activity in primary motor cortex. We attempted to predict the observed distribution of redundant neural activity. Principles inspired by work on muscular redundancy did not accurately predict these distributions. Surprisingly, the distributions of redundant neural activity and task-relevant activity were coupled, which enabled accurate predictions of the distributions of redundant activity. This suggests limits on the extent to which redundancy may be exploited by the brain for computation.},

To translate preclinical results from intact animals to a clinically useful NMP, movement signals must persist in cortex after spinal cord injury and be engaged by movement intent when sensory inputs and limb movement are long absent. Furthermore, NMPs would require that intention-driven neuronal activity be converted into a control signal that enables useful tasks. Here we show initial results for a tetraplegic human (MN) using a pilot NMP. Neuronal ensemble activity recorded through a 96-microelectrode array implanted in primary motor cortex demonstrated that intended hand motion modulates cortical spiking patterns three years after spinal cord injury. Decoders were created, providing a `neural cursor' with which MN opened simulated e-mail and operated devices such as a television, even while conversing. Furthermore, MN used neural control to open and close a prosthetic hand, and perform rudimentary actions with a multi-jointed robotic arm.

This idea is based on the assumption that individual neurons can be conditioned independently regardless of their natural movement association. Results We tested this assumption in the parietal reach region (PRR), an important candidate area for BMIs in which neurons encode the target location for reaching movements. Monkeys could learn to elicit arbitrarily assigned activity patterns, but the seemingly arbitrary patterns always belonged to the response set for natural reaching movements. Moreover, neurons that are free from conditioning showed correlated responses with the conditioned neurons as if they encoded common reach targets. Thus, learning was accomplished by finding reach targets (intrinsic variable of PRR neurons) for which the natural response of reach planning could approximate the arbitrary patterns. Conclusions Our results suggest that animals learn to volitionally control single-neuron activity in PRR by preferentially exploring and exploiting their natural movement repertoire. Thus, for optimal performance, BMIs utilizing neural signals in PRR should harness, not disregard, the activity patterns in the natural sensorimotor repertoire.},

Using a brain-computer interface, dozens of simultaneously recorded neurons in the motor cortex of awake, behaving monkeys are used to control the movement of a cursor in a three-dimensional virtual-reality environment. This device creates a precise, well-defined mapping between the firing of the recorded neurons and an expressed behavior (cursor movement). In a series of experiments, we force the animal to relearn the association between neural firing and cursor movement in a subset of neurons and assess how the network changes to compensate. We find that changes in neural activity reflect not only an alteration of behavioral strategy but also the relative contributions of individual neurons to the population error signal.},

One of the main obstacles for high-performance BMI is the noise-prone nature of traditional decoding methods that connect neural response explicitly with physical quantity, such as velocity. In contrast, the recent development of latent neural state model enables a robust readout of large-scale neuronal population activity contents. However, these latent neural states do not necessarily contain kinematic information useful for decoding. Therefore, this study proposes a new approach to finding kinematics-dependent latent factors by extracting latent factors' kinematics-dependent components using linear regression. We estimated these components from the population activity through nonlinear mapping. The proposed kinematics-dependent latent factors generate neural trajectories that discriminate latent neural states before and after the motion onset. We compared the decoding performance of the proposed analysis model with the results from other popular models. They are factor analysis (FA), Gaussian process factor analysis (GPFA), latent factor analysis via dynamical systems (LFADS), preferential subspace identification (PSID), and neuronal population firing rates. The proposed analysis model results in higher decoding accuracy than do the others ({$>$}17\% improvement on average). Our approach may pave a new way to extract latent neural states specific to kinematic information from motor cortices, potentially improving decoding performance for online intracortical BMIs.},

In this context, we investigated the effects of spontaneous mental strategies on NF performance. Twenty healthy participants performed either a SMR (sensorimotor rhythm, 12-15 Hz) based or a Gamma (40-43 Hz) based NF training over ten sessions. After the first and the last training session, they were asked to write down which mental strategy they have used for self-regulating their EEG. After the first session, all participants reported the use of various types of mental strategies such as visual strategies, concentration, or relaxation. After the last NF training session, four participants of the SMR group reported to employ no specific strategy. These four participants showed linear improvements in NF performance over the ten training sessions. In contrast, participants still reporting the use of specific mental strategies in the last NF session showed no changes in SMR based NF performance over the ten sessions. This effect could not be observed in the Gamma group. The Gamma group showed no prominent changes in Gamma power over the NF training sessions, regardless of the mental strategies used. These results indicate that successful SMR based NF performance is associated with implicit learning mechanisms. Participants stating vivid reports on strategies to control their SMR probably overload cognitive resources, which might be counterproductive in terms of increasing SMR power.},

In particular, it was shown that the three-dimensional tuning curves of neurons whose decoding parameters were reassigned changed more than those of neurons whose decoding parameters had not been reassigned. In this article, we propose a simple learning rule that can reproduce this effect. Our learning rule uses Hebbian weight updates driven by a global reward signal and neuronal noise. In contrast to most previously proposed learning rules, this approach does not require extrinsic information to separate noise from signal. The learning rule is able to optimize the performance of a model system within biologically realistic periods of time under high noise levels. Furthermore, when the model parameters are matched to data recorded during the brain\textendash computer interface learning experiments described above, the model produces learning effects strikingly similar to those found in the experiments.},

  abstract = {Learning often involves adapting behavior in response to the inferred causes of success and failure. At the neural level, this can be the result of repeating activity patterns of neurons that lead to favorable outcomes. However, it is not clear how the contributions of individual cells to an ongoing behavior is assessed. Using a calcium imaging based closed loop Brain-Machine Interface (CaBMI), we trained mice to perform a neuroprosthetic task using the coordinated activity of a small ensemble of neurons in layer 2/3 of sensorimotor cortex. We find that that after an initial period of exploration, neurons that do not directly drive the effector decrease in both variance and event frequency over the course of learning. However, a large fraction of these `indirect' cells demonstrate robust spatiotemporal dynamics both before and after an animal achieves reward. Throughout a single 30 minute session, these spatiotemporal sequences increase in frequency and become more consistent. Our findings suggest that neuroprosthetic control is the result of an emergent, spatially organized network level solution, rather than the direct modulation of a few chosen output neurons.},

It has long been recognized that both the user and decoding system can adapt to increase the accuracy of the end effector. Co-adaptation is the process whereby a user learns to control the system in conjunction with the decoder adapting to learn the user's neural patterns. We provide a mathematical framework for co-adaptation and relate co-adaptation to the joint optimization of the user's control scheme ("encoding model") and the decoding algorithm's parameters. When the assumptions of that framework are respected, co-adaptation cannot yield better performance than that obtainable by an optimal initial choice of fixed decoder, coupled with optimal user learning. For a specific case, we provide numerical methods to obtain such an optimized decoder. We demonstrate our approach in a model brain-computer interface system using an online prosthesis simulator, a simple human-in-the-loop pyschophysics setup which provides a non-invasive simulation of the BCI setting. These experiments support two claims: that users can learn encoders matched to fixed, optimal decoders and that, once learned, our approach yields expected performance advantages.},

Supporting this promise, animals\textemdash including humans\textemdash can learn even arbitrary mapping between the activity of cortical neurons and movement of prosthetic devices [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, the performance of neuroprosthetic device control has been nowhere near that of limb control in healthy individuals, presenting a dire need to improve the performance. One potential limitation is the fact that previous work has not distinguished diverse cell types in the neocortex, even though different cell types possess distinct functions in cortical computations [5, 6, 7] and likely distinct capacities to control brain-computer interfaces. Here, we made a first step in addressing this issue by tracking the plastic changes of three~major types of cortical inhibitory neurons (INs) during a neuron-pair operant conditioning task using two-photon imaging of IN subtypes expressing GCaMP6f. Mice were rewarded when the activity of the positive target neuron (N+) exceeded that of the negative target neuron (N-) beyond a set threshold. Mice improved performance with all subtypes, but the strategies were subtype specific. When parvalbumin (PV)-expressing INs were targeted, the activity of N- decreased. However, targeting of somatostatin (SOM)- and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing INs led to an increase of the N+ activity. These results demonstrate that INs can be individually modulated in a subtype-specific manner and highlight the versatility of neural circuits in adapting to new demands by using cell-type-specific strategies.},

We present the first generic theoretical formulation of the co-adaptive learning problem and give a simple example of two interacting linear learning systems, a human and a machine. Approach. After the description of the training protocol of the two learning systems, we define a simple linear model where the two learning agents are coupled by a joint loss function. The simplicity of the model allows us to find learning rules for both human and machine that permit computing theoretical simulations. Main results. As seen in simulations, an astonishingly rich structure is found for this eco-system of learners. While the co-adaptive learners are shown to easily stall or get out of sync for some parameter settings, we can find a broad sweet spot of parameters where the learning system can converge quickly. It is defined by mid-range learning rates on the side of the learning machine, quite independent of the human in the loop. Despite its simplistic assumptions the theoretical study could be confirmed by a real-world experimental study where human and machine co-adapt to perform cursor control under distortion. Also in this practical setting the mid-range learning rates yield the best performance and behavioral ratings. Significance. The results presented in this mathematical study allow the computation of simple theoretical simulations and performance of real experimental paradigms. Additionally, they are nicely in line with previous results in the BCI literature.},

Here we expand on this work by showing that PPC neural activity can be harnessed to estimate not only the endpoint but also to continuously control the trajectory of an end effector. Specifically, we trained two monkeys to use a joystick to guide a cursor on a computer screen to peripheral target locations while maintaining central ocular fixation. We found that we could accurately reconstruct the trajectory of the cursor using a relatively small ensemble of simultaneously recorded PPC neurons. Using a goal-based Kalman filter that incorporates target information into the state-space, we showed that the decoded estimate of cursor position could be significantly improved. Finally, we tested whether we could decode trajectories during closed-loop brain control sessions, in which the real-time position of the cursor was determined solely by a monkey's neural activity in PPC. The monkey learned to perform brain control trajectories at 80\% success rate (for 8 targets) after just 4\textendash 5 sessions. This improvement in behavioral performance was accompanied by a corresponding enhancement in neural tuning properties (i.e., increased tuning depth and coverage of encoding parameter space) as well as an increase in off-line decoding performance of the PPC ensemble.},

Brain-machine interfaces have used instrumental conditioning to reinforce patterns of neural activity directly, especially in frontal and motor cortices, which are a rich source of signals for voluntary action. However, evidence suggests that activity in primary sensory cortices may also reflect internally driven processes, instead of purely encoding antecedent stimuli. Here, we show that rats and mice can learn to produce arbitrary patterns of neural activity in their primary visual cortex to control an auditory cursor and obtain reward. Furthermore, learning was prevented when neurons in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), which receives input from visual cortex, were optogenetically inhibited, but not during inhibition of nearby neurons in the dorsolateral striatum. After learning, DMS inhibition did not affect production of the rewarded patterns. These data demonstrate that cortico-basal ganglia circuits play a general role in learning to produce cortical activity that leads to desirable outcomes.},

Here, we explore the use of decoder adaptation to shape neuroplasticity in two scenarios relevant for real-world neuroprostheses: nonstationary recordings of neural activity and changes in control context. Nonhuman primates learned to control a cursor to perform a reaching task~using semistationary neural activity in two contexts: with and without simultaneous arm movements. Decoder adaptation was used to improve initial performance and compensate for changes in neural recordings. We show that beneficial neuroplasticity can occur alongside decoder adaptation, yielding performance improvements, skill retention, and resistance to interference from native motor networks.

BMIs precisely define the information streams into and out of the brain, but engage wide-spread learning. We take a network perspective and review existing observations of learning in motor BMIs to show that BMIs engage multiple learning mechanisms distributed across neural networks.

Nevertheless, we posit that current research trends are heavily biased toward the machine-learning side of BMI training. In this article, we take a critical view of the relevant literature, and our own previous work, to identify the key issues for more effective mutual-learning schemes in translational BMIs that are specifically tailored to promote subject learning. We identify the main caveats in the literature on subject learning in BMI, in particular, the lack of longitudinal studies involving end users and shortcomings in quantifying subject learning, and pinpoint critical improvements for future experimental designs.},

However, recalibration is often necessary as the decoder off-line predictive power does not generally imply ease-of-use, due to closed loop dynamics and user adaptation that cannot be accounted for during the calibration procedure. Here, we propose an adaptive interface that makes use of a non-linear autoencoder trained iteratively to perform online manifold identification and tracking, with the dual goal of reducing the need for interface recalibration and enhancing human-machine joint performance. Importantly, the proposed approach avoids interrupting the operation of the device and it neither relies on information about the state of the task, nor on the existence of a stable neural or movement manifold, allowing it to be applied in the earliest stages of interface operation, when the formation of new neural strategies is still on-going. In order to more directly test the performance of our algorithm, we defined the autoencoder latent space as the control space of a body-machine interface. After an initial offline parameter tuning, we evaluated the performance of the adaptive interface versus that of a static decoder in approximating the evolving low-dimensional manifold of users simultaneously learning to perform reaching movements within the latent space. Results show that the adaptive approach increased the representational efficiency of the interface decoder. Concurrently, it significantly improved users' task-related performance, indicating that the development of a more accurate internal model is encouraged by the online co-adaptation process.},

To overcome this limitation, we examined the mechanisms of learning and its limits in a human intracortical brain-machine interface (BMI) paradigm. A tetraplegic participant controlled a 2D computer cursor by modulating single-neuron activity in the anterior intraparietal area (AIP). By perturbing the neuron-to-movement mapping, the participant learned to modulate the activity of the recorded neurons to solve the perturbations by adopting a target re-aiming strategy. However, when no cognitive strategies were adequate to produce correct responses, AIP failed to adapt to perturbations. These findings suggest that learning is constrained by the pre-existing neuronal structure, although it is possible that AIP needs more training time to learn to generate novel activity patterns when cognitive re-adaptation fails to solve the perturbations.},

This was accomplished by training participants to simultaneously control ongoing brain activity in circumscribed motor and memory-related brain areas, namely the supplementary motor area and the parahippocampal cortex. We found that learned voluntary control over these functionally distinct brain areas caused functionally specific behavioral effects, i.e. shortening of motor reaction times and specific interference with memory encoding. The neurofeedback approach goes beyond improving cognitive efficiency by unspecific psychological factors such as attention, arousal, or motivation. It allows for directly manipulating sustained activity of task-relevant brain regions in order to yield specific behavioral or cognitive effects.},

Here, we explore the influence of control and feedback rates, where control rate indicates how often motor commands are sent from the brain to the prosthetic, and feedback rate indicates how often visual feedback of the prosthetic is provided to the subject. We developed a new BMI that allows arbitrarily fast control and feedback rates, and used it to dissociate the effects of each rate in two monkeys. Increasing the control rate significantly improved control even when feedback rate was unchanged. Increasing the feedback rate further facilitated control. We also show that our high-rate BMI significantly outperformed state-of-the-art methods due to higher control and feedback rates, combined with a different point process mathematical encoding model. Our BMI paradigm can dissect the contribution of different elements in the sensorimotor pathway, providing a unique tool for studying neuroprosthetic control mechanisms.},

To develop methods that allow stable performance without recalibration, we used a 128-channel chronic electrocorticography (ECoG) implant in a paralyzed individual, which allowed stable monitoring of signals. We show that long-term closed-loop decoder adaptation, in which decoder weights are carried across sessions over multiple days, results in consolidation of a neural map and `plug-and-play' control. In contrast, daily reinitialization led to degradation of performance with variable relearning. Consolidation also allowed the addition of control features over days, that is, long-term stacking of dimensions. Our results offer an approach for reliable, stable BCI control by leveraging the stability of ECoG interfaces and neural plasticity.},

We demonstrate that the RNN, an ESN implementation termed a FORCE decoder (from first order reduced and controlled error learning), learns the task quickly and significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art method, the velocity Kalman filter (VKF), using the measure of target acquire time. We also demonstrate that the FORCE decoder generalizes to a more difficult task by successfully operating the BMI in a randomized point-to-point task. The FORCE decoder is also robust as measured by the success rate over extended sessions. Finally, we show that decoded cursor dynamics are more like naturalistic hand movements than those of the VKF. Taken together, these results suggest that RNNs in general, and the FORCE decoder in particular, are powerful tools for BMI decoder applications.},

During performance, an error signal emerges representing the difference between what was predicted and what actually happened. Several studies have focused on understanding how error signals emerges. Yet, the predictions needed to compute these error signals are still unclear. It has been suggested that the ventral striatum, may be the responsible for encoding a prediction function. So far, there is no clear evidence that these predictions are present in the ventral striatum or which different roles dorsal and the ventral striatum may be playing during neuroprosthetic control. To that effect, we trained rats to control a brain-machine-interface (BMI) with motor cortex units while recording the activity in striatum. Our results show that neuronal activity of the ventral striatum could predict future outcome and that this prediction coincided with the state prediction of a temporal difference model of reinforcement learning.

These tasks helped evaluate whether and how cortical changes resulting from ``covert rehearsal'' affect overt performance. We found that covert learning indeed transfers to overt performance and is accompanied by systematic population-level changes in motor preparatory activity. Current models of motor cortical function ascribe motor preparation to achieving initial conditions favorable for subsequent movement-period neural dynamics. We found that covert and overt contexts share these initial conditions, and covert rehearsal manipulates them in a manner that persists across context changes, thus facilitating overt motor learning.

When using an intracortical BCI (iBCI), users modulate their neural population activity to move an effector towards a target, stop accurately, and correct for movement errors. We call the rules that govern this modulation a `feedback control policy'. A better understanding of these policies may inform the design of higher-performing neural decoders. Approach. We studied how three participants in the BrainGate2 pilot clinical trial used an iBCI to control a cursor in a 2D target acquisition task. Participants used a velocity decoder with exponential smoothing dynamics. Through offline analyses, we characterized the users' feedback control policies by modeling their neural activity as a function of cursor state and target position. We also tested whether users could adapt their policy to different decoder dynamics by varying the gain (speed scaling) and temporal smoothing parameters of the iBCI. Main results. We demonstrate that control policy assumptions made in previous studies do not fully describe the policies of our participants. To account for these discrepancies, we propose a new model that captures (1) how the user's neural population activity gradually declines as the cursor approaches the target from afar, then decreases more sharply as the cursor comes into contact with the target, (2) how the user makes constant feedback corrections even when the cursor is on top of the target, and (3) how the user actively accounts for the cursor's current velocity to avoid overshooting the target. Further, we show that users can adapt their control policy to decoder dynamics by attenuating neural modulation when the cursor gain is high and by damping the cursor velocity more strongly when the smoothing dynamics are high. Significance. Our control policy model may help to build better decoders, understand how neural activity varies during active iBCI control, and produce better simulations of closed-loop iBCI movements.},

Three participants in the BrainGate2 pilot clinical trial controlled a computer cursor using a linear velocity decoder under different gain (speed scaling) and temporal smoothing parameters and acquired targets with different radii and distances. We show that a user-specific iBCI feedback control model can predict how performance changes under these different decoder and task parameters in held-out data. We also used the model to optimize a nonlinear speed scaling function for the decoder. When used online with two participants, it increased the dynamic range of decoded speeds and decreased the time taken to acquire targets (compared to an optimized standard decoder). These results suggest that it is feasible to simulate iBCI performance accurately enough to be useful for quantitative decoder optimization and design.},

  abstract = {Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) use signals acquired from the brain to control actuators such as computer cursors or robotic arms, with potential to restore motor function to individuals with disabilities. While the process of learning and controlling a BMI is complex, involving cortico-striatal networks, it has been well-established that the brain is able to learn to control BMI actuators using relatively few neurons as direct inputs into the decoder. In particular, neurons that are used as inputs to a BMI decoder (direct neurons) experience changes in direction tuning and modulation depth, eventually forming a stable neuroprosthetic map. Furthermore, previous work has shown that indirect neurons (those that are not inputs to the decoder) also form a stable neuroprosthetic map that differs from manual reaching. However, it is still unclear how these changes in indirect units are formed over the course of learning. We found that indirect neurons adapted similarly to that of direct neurons over learning. Indirect neurons formed a stabilized tuning map, decreased neural dimensionality, and consolidated firing activity into more correlated patterns. Furthermore, direct and indirect neurons adapted together, not only coordinating activity within each population, but across populations as well. Together, our results show that indirect neurons change alongside direct neurons, suggesting a large-scale neural search and adaptation for direct neurons.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Controlling the trajectory of a neuroprosthetic device to reach multiple targets is a commonly used brain-machine interface (BMI) task in primates and has not been available for rodents yet. Here, we describe a novel experimental paradigm which enables this task for rats in one-dimensional space for reaching two distant targets depending on their limited cognitive and visual capabilities compared to primates. An online transform was used to convert the activity of a pair of primary motor cortex (M1) units into two robotic actions. The rats were shaped to adapt to the transform and direct the robotic actuator toward the selected target by modulating the activity of the M1 neurons. All three rats involved in the study were capable of achieving randomly selected targets with at least 78\% accuracy. A total of 9 out of 16 pairs of units examined were eligible for exceeding this success criterion. Two out of three rats were capable of reversal learning, where the mapping between the activity of the unit pairs and the robotic actions were reversed. The present work is the first demonstration of trajectory-based control of a neuroprosthetic device by rodents to reach two targets using visual feedback. The paradigm introduced here may be used as a cost-effective platform for elucidating the information processing principles in the neural circuits related to neuroprosthetic control and for studying the performance of novel BMI technologies using freely moving rats.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {What are the neural mechanisms of skill acquisition? Many studies find that long-term practice is associated with a functional reorganization of cortical neural activity. However, the link between these changes in neural activity and the behavioral improvements that occur is not well understood, especially for long-term learning that takes place over several weeks. To probe this link in detail, we leveraged a brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm in which rhesus monkeys learned to master nonintuitive mappings between neural spiking in primary motor cortex and computer cursor movement. Critically, these BCI mappings were designed to disambiguate several different possible types of neural reorganization. We found that during the initial phase of learning, lasting minutes to hours, rapid changes in neural activity common to all neurons led to a fast suppression of motor error. In parallel, local changes to individual neurons gradually accrued over several weeks of training. This slower timescale cortical reorganization persisted long after the movement errors had decreased to asymptote and was associated with more efficient control of movement. We conclude that long-term practice evokes two distinct neural reorganization processes with vastly different timescales, leading to different aspects of improvement in motor behavior.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY We leveraged a brain-computer interface learning paradigm to track the neural reorganization occurring throughout the full time course of motor skill learning lasting several weeks. We report on two distinct types of neural reorganization that mirror distinct phases of behavioral improvement: a fast phase, in which global reorganization of neural recruitment leads to a quick suppression of motor error, and a slow phase, in which local changes in individual tuning lead to improvements in movement efficiency.}
