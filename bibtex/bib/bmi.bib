  title = {Local Network Coordination Supports Neuroprosthetic Control},
  abstract = {Learning often involves adapting behavior in response to the inferred causes of success and failure. At the neural level, this can be the result of repeating activity patterns of neurons that lead to favorable outcomes. However, it is not clear how the contributions of individual cells to an ongoing behavior is assessed. Using a calcium imaging based closed loop Brain-Machine Interface (CaBMI), we trained mice to perform a neuroprosthetic task using the coordinated activity of a small ensemble of neurons in layer 2/3 of sensorimotor cortex. We find that that after an initial period of exploration, neurons that do not directly drive the effector decrease in both variance and event frequency over the course of learning. However, a large fraction of these `indirect' cells demonstrate robust spatiotemporal dynamics both before and after an animal achieves reward. Throughout a single 30 minute session, these spatiotemporal sequences increase in frequency and become more consistent. Our findings suggest that neuroprosthetic control is the result of an emergent, spatially organized network level solution, rather than the direct modulation of a few chosen output neurons.},

  abstract = {Neuroplasticity may play a critical role in developing robust, naturally controlled neuroprostheses. This learning, however, is sensitive to system changes such as the neural activity used for control. The ultimate utility of neuroplasticity in real-world neuroprostheses is thus unclear. Adaptive decoding methods hold promise for improving neuroprosthetic performance in nonstationary systems. Here, we explore the use of decoder adaptation to shape neuroplasticity in two scenarios relevant for real-world neuroprostheses: nonstationary recordings of neural activity and changes in control context. Nonhuman primates learned to control a cursor to perform a reaching task~using semistationary neural activity in two contexts: with and without simultaneous arm movements. Decoder adaptation was used to improve initial performance and compensate for changes in neural recordings. We show that beneficial neuroplasticity can occur alongside decoder adaptation, yielding performance improvements, skill retention, and resistance to interference from native motor networks. These results highlight the utility of neuroplasticity for real-world neuroprostheses.},

  abstract = {Neuronal motor commands, whether generating real~or neuroprosthetic movements, are shaped by ongoing sensory feedback from the displacement being produced. Here we asked if cortical stimulation could provide artificial feedback during operant conditioning of cortical neurons. Simultaneous two-photon imaging and real-time optogenetic stimulation were used to train mice to activate a single neuron in motor cortex (M1), while continuous feedback of its activity level was provided by proportionally stimulating somatosensory cortex. This artificial signal was necessary to rapidly learn to increase the conditioned activity, detect correct performance, and maintain the learned behavior. Population imaging in M1 revealed that learning-related activity changes are observed in the conditioned cell only, which highlights the functional potential of individual neurons in the neocortex. Our findings demonstrate the capacity of animals to use an artificially induced cortical channel in a behaviorally relevant way and reveal the remarkable speed and specificity at which this can occur.},

  abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces have seen an increase in popularity due to their potential for direct neuroprosthetic applications for amputees and disabled individuals. Supporting this promise, animals\textemdash{}including humans\textemdash{}can learn even arbitrary mapping between the activity of cortical neurons and movement of prosthetic devices [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, the performance of neuroprosthetic device control has been nowhere near that of limb control in healthy individuals, presenting a dire need to improve the performance. One potential limitation is the fact that previous work has not distinguished diverse cell types in the neocortex, even though different cell types possess distinct functions in cortical computations [5, 6, 7] and likely distinct capacities to control brain-computer interfaces. Here, we made a first step in addressing this issue by tracking the plastic changes of three~major types of cortical inhibitory neurons (INs) during a neuron-pair operant conditioning task using two-photon imaging of IN subtypes expressing GCaMP6f. Mice were rewarded when the activity of the positive target neuron (N+) exceeded that of the negative target neuron (N-) beyond a set threshold. Mice improved performance with all subtypes, but the strategies were subtype specific. When parvalbumin (PV)-expressing INs were targeted, the activity of N- decreased. However, targeting of somatostatin (SOM)- and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing INs led to an increase of the N+ activity. These results demonstrate that INs can be individually modulated in a subtype-specific manner and highlight the versatility of neural circuits in adapting to new demands by using cell-type-specific strategies.},

  abstract = {Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) use signals acquired from the brain to control actuators such as computer cursors or robotic arms, with potential to restore motor function to individuals with disabilities. While the process of learning and controlling a BMI is complex, involving cortico-striatal networks, it has been well-established that the brain is able to learn to control BMI actuators using relatively few neurons as direct inputs into the decoder. In particular, neurons that are used as inputs to a BMI decoder (direct neurons) experience changes in direction tuning and modulation depth, eventually forming a stable neuroprosthetic map. Furthermore, previous work has shown that indirect neurons (those that are not inputs to the decoder) also form a stable neuroprosthetic map that differs from manual reaching. However, it is still unclear how these changes in indirect units are formed over the course of learning. We found that indirect neurons adapted similarly to that of direct neurons over learning. Indirect neurons formed a stabilized tuning map, decreased neural dimensionality, and consolidated firing activity into more correlated patterns. Furthermore, direct and indirect neurons adapted together, not only coordinating activity within each population, but across populations as well. Together, our results show that indirect neurons change alongside direct neurons, suggesting a large-scale neural search and adaptation for direct neurons.},

  abstract = {During neuroprosthetic control, prediction of future outcome plays a key role, by informing about current performance, so the subject can correct and refine its actions. During performance, an error signal emerges representing the difference between what was predicted and what actually happened. Several studies have focused on understanding how error signals emerges. Yet, the predictions needed to compute these error signals are still unclear. It has been suggested that the ventral striatum, may be the responsible for encoding a prediction function. So far, there is no clear evidence that these predictions are present in the ventral striatum or which different roles dorsal and the ventral striatum may be playing during neuroprosthetic control. To that effect, we trained rats to control a brain-machine-interface (BMI) with motor cortex units while recording the activity in striatum. Our results show that neuronal activity of the ventral striatum could predict future outcome and that this prediction coincided with the state prediction of a temporal difference model of reinforcement learning. These results highlight the relevance of the ventral striatum during neuroprosthetic control and point towards the use of neuronal prediction information to improve brain-machine-interfaces.},

  abstract = {Animals acquire behaviors through instrumental conditioning. Brain-machine interfaces have used instrumental conditioning to reinforce patterns of neural activity directly, especially in frontal and motor cortices, which are a rich source of signals for voluntary action. However, evidence suggests that activity in primary sensory cortices may also reflect internally driven processes, instead of purely encoding antecedent stimuli. Here, we show that rats and mice can learn to produce arbitrary patterns of neural activity in their primary visual cortex to control an auditory cursor and obtain reward. Furthermore, learning was prevented when neurons in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), which receives input from visual cortex, were optogenetically inhibited, but not during inhibition of nearby neurons in the dorsolateral striatum. After learning, DMS inhibition did not affect production of the rewarded patterns. These data demonstrate that cortico-basal ganglia circuits play a general role in learning to produce cortical activity that leads to desirable outcomes.},

  abstract = {During motor learning, movements and underlying neural activity initially exhibit large trial-to-trial variability that decreases over learning. However, it is unclear how task-relevant neural populations coordinate to explore and consolidate activity patterns. Exploration and consolidation could happen for each neuron independently, across the population jointly, or both. We disambiguated among these possibilities by investigating how subjects learned de novo to control a brain-machine interface using neurons from motor cortex. We decomposed population activity into the sum of private and shared signals, which produce uncorrelated and correlated neural variance, respectively, and examined how these signals' evolution causally shapes behavior. We found that initially large trial-to-trial movement and private neural variability reduce over learning. Concomitantly, task-relevant shared variance increases, consolidating a manifold containing consistent neural trajectories that generate refined control. These results suggest that motor cortex acquires skillful control by leveraging both independent and coordinated variance to explore and consolidate neural patterns.},
