  abstract = {Trial-to-trial variability can result from both deterministic sources, such as complex dynamics or internal states, and randomness {\textemdash} that is, noise. This Review focuses on noise and its impact along the behavioural loop.Sensory noise is noise in sensory signals and sensory receptors. It limits the amount of information that is available to other areas of the CNS.Cellular noise is an underestimated contributor to neuronal variability. The stochastic nature of neuronal mechanisms becomes critical in the many small structures of the CNS.Electrical noise in neurons, especially channel noise from voltage-gated ion channels, limits neuronal reliability and cell size, producing millisecond variability in action-potential initiation and propagation.Synaptic noise results from the noisy biochemical processes that underlie synaptic transmission. Adding up these noise sources can account for the observed postsynaptic-response variability.Noise build-up in neural networks can be contained by appropriate network layouts, homeostatic mechanisms and the threshold-like nature of neurons.Motor noise results when neural signals are converted into forces. The architecture of motor neurons and their muscle fibres makes the conversion noisy. The brain organizes movements to minimize the effects of motor noise on movement variability.Beneficial effects of noise include stochastic resonance in specific cases of sensory processing and forcing neural networks to be more robust and explore more states.Behavioural variability, as observed in sensory estimation and movement tasks, appears to be mainly produced by noise.The principle of averaging is one of two fundamental principles applied by the CNS to compensate for noise by summing over sources of redundant information.The principle of prior knowledge is the other fundamental principle: it exploits the expected nature of signals and noise. The CNS often applies it in combination with averaging, such as in Bayesian cue combination in sensory processing.},

This behavioral pattern could be described using a Bayesian model.

Here the authors show that granule cells within the cerebellum-like structure of weakly electric fish have delayed responses that closely match the timing of self-generated sensory inputs. This enables corollary discharges to be transformed into negative images that are well-tuned to the animal's own behavior.},

  abstract = {Statistical regularities in the environment create prior beliefs that we rely on to optimize our behavior when sensory information is uncertain. Bayesian theory formalizes how prior beliefs can be leveraged and has had a major impact on models of perception, sensorimotor function, and cognition. However, it is not known how recurrent interactions among neurons mediate Bayesian integration. By using a time-interval reproduction task in monkeys, we found that prior statistics warp neural representations in the frontal cortex, allowing the mapping of sensory inputs to motor outputs to incorporate prior statistics in accordance with Bayesian inference. Analysis of recurrent neural network models performing the task revealed that this warping was enabled by a low-dimensional curved manifold and allowed us to further probe the potential causal underpinnings of this computational strategy. These results uncover a simple and general principle whereby prior beliefs exert their influence on behavior by sculpting cortical latent dynamics.},
