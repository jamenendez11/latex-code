  abstract = {The authors find that a person's estimate of a time interval exhibits biases that depend on both its duration and the distribution from which it is drawn. This behavioral pattern could be described using a Bayesian model. These findings suggest that internal timing mechanisms can adapt to the temporal statistics of the environment to minimize uncertainty.},

  abstract = {To adaptively navigate their environments organisms need to predict and cancel out the sensory consequences of their actions. Here the authors show that granule cells within the cerebellum-like structure of weakly electric fish have delayed responses that closely match the timing of self-generated sensory inputs. This enables corollary discharges to be transformed into negative images that are well-tuned to the animal's own behavior.},

  abstract = {Statistical regularities in the environment create prior beliefs that we rely on to optimize our behavior when sensory information is uncertain. Bayesian theory formalizes how prior beliefs can be leveraged and has had a major impact on models of perception, sensorimotor function, and cognition. However, it is not known how recurrent interactions among neurons mediate Bayesian integration. By using a time-interval reproduction task in monkeys, we found that prior statistics warp neural representations in the frontal cortex, allowing the mapping of sensory inputs to motor outputs to incorporate prior statistics in accordance with Bayesian inference. Analysis of recurrent neural network models performing the task revealed that this warping was enabled by a low-dimensional curved manifold and allowed us to further probe the potential causal underpinnings of this computational strategy. These results uncover a simple and general principle whereby prior beliefs exert their influence on behavior by sculpting cortical latent dynamics.},
