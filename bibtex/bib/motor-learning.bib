  abstract = {During extended motor adaptation, learning appears to saturate despite persistence of residual errors. This adaptation limit is not fixed but varies with perturbation variance; when variance is high, residual errors become larger. These changes in total adaptation could relate to either implicit or explicit learning systems. Here, we found that when adaptation relied solely on the explicit system, residual errors disappeared and learning was unaltered by perturbation variability. In contrast, when learning depended entirely, or in part, on implicit learning, residual errors reappeared. Total implicit adaptation decreased in the high-variance environment due to changes in error sensitivity, not in forgetting. These observations suggest a model in which the implicit system becomes more sensitive to errors when they occur in a consistent direction. Thus, residual errors in motor adaptation are at least in part caused by an implicit learning system that modulates its error sensitivity in response to the consistency of past errors.},

Recent neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies demonstrate that large-scale neural dynamics inhabit a low-dimensional subspace or manifold, and that learning is constrained by this intrinsic manifold architecture. Here, we asked, using functional MRI, whether subject-level differences in neural excursion from manifold structure can explain differences in learning across participants. We had subjects perform a sensorimotor adaptation task in the MRI scanner on 2 consecutive days, allowing us to assess their learning performance across days, as well as continuously measure brain activity. We find that the overall neural excursion from manifold activity in both cognitive and sensorimotor brain networks is associated with differences in subjects' patterns of learning and relearning across days. These findings suggest that off-manifold activity provides an index of the relative engagement of different neural systems during learning, and that subject differences in patterns of learning and relearning are related to reconfiguration processes occurring in cognitive and sensorimotor networks.},

Here we show that different motor learning tasks induce dendritic Ca2+ spikes on different apical tuft branches of individual layer V pyramidal neurons in the mouse motor cortex. These task-related, branch-specific Ca2+ spikes cause long-lasting potentiation of postsynaptic dendritic spines active at the time of spike generation. When somatostatin-expressing interneurons are inactivated, different motor tasks frequently induce Ca2+ spikes on the same branches. On those branches, spines potentiated during one task are depotentiated when they are active seconds before Ca2+ spikes induced by another task. Concomitantly, increased neuronal activity and performance improvement after learning one task are disrupted when another task is learned. These findings indicate that dendritic-branch-specific generation of Ca2+ spikes is crucial for establishing long-lasting synaptic plasticity, thereby facilitating information storage associated with different learning experiences.},

In vivo imaging of AS-PaRac1 revealed that a motor learning task induced substantial synaptic remodelling in a small subset of neurons. The acquired motor learning was disrupted by the optical shrinkage of the potentiated spines, whereas it was not affected by the identical manipulation of spines evoked by a distinct motor task in the same cortical region. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a newly acquired motor skill depends on the formation of a task-specific dense synaptic ensemble.},

  abstract = {Humans have a remarkable capacity to learn new motor behaviours without forgetting old ones. This capacity relies on the ability to acquire and express multiple motor memories without interference. Here we combine behavioural experiments and computational modelling to investigate how the sensorimotor system uses contextual information to create, update and recall motor memories. We first examine the role of muscle co-contraction in the learning of novel movement dynamics. We show that muscle co-contraction, as measured by surface electromyography, accelerates motor learning. We then explore the role of control points on objects in the formation of motor memories during object manipulation. We show that opposing dynamic perturbations, which interfere when controlling a single location on an object, can be learned when each is associated with a separate control point. To account for these results, we develop a parametric switching state-space model, in which the association between cues (control points) and contexts (dynamics) is learned from experience rather than fixed. We then extend this model to a Bayesian nonparametric switching state-space model, in which the number of contexts and cues are learned online rather than specified in advance. This model can instantiate new memories when novel perturbations are experienced and exhibits spontaneous recovery of a memory that has been ostensibly overwritten. To test the model, we perform an experiment in which we briefly present a previously experienced perturbation after behaviour has returned to baseline. As predicted, we observe a qualitatively distinct and more pronounced form of recovery, which we refer to as evoked recovery. Finally, we investigate Bayesian context estimation using single-trial learning. We show that people are able to learn novel associations between cues and contexts and that they use both contextual cues and state feedback to infer the current context and partition learning between memories. Taken together, these findings further the understanding of the behaviour and computational principles of sensorimotor learning under switching dynamics.},

  abstract = {Behavioral and neurophysiological studies suggest that skill learning can be mediated by discrete, experience-driven changes within specific neural representations subserving the performance of the trained task. We have shown that a few minutes of daily practice on a sequential finger opposition task induced large, incremental performance gains over a few weeks of training. These gains did not generalize to the contralateral hand nor to a matched sequence of identical component movements, suggesting that a lateralized representation of the learned sequence of movements evolved through practice. This interpretation was supported by functional MRI data showing that a more extensive representation of the trained sequence emerged in primary motor cortex after 3 weeks of training. The imaging data, however, also indicated important changes occurring in primary motor cortex during the initial scanning sessions, which we proposed may reflect the setting up of a task-specific motor processing routine. Here we provide behavioral and functional MRI data on experience-dependent changes induced by a limited amount of repetitions within the first imaging session. We show that this limited training experience can be sufficient to trigger performance gains that require time to become evident. We propose that skilled motor performance is acquired in several stages: ``fast'' learning, an initial, within-session improvement phase, followed by a period of consolidation of several hours duration, and then ``slow'' learning, consisting of delayed, incremental gains in performance emerging after continued practice. This time course may reflect basic mechanisms of neuronal plasticity in the adult brain that subserve the acquisition and retention of many different skills.},

Motor skill does not, however, develop uniformly across training sessions. It is characterized by an initial fast phase, followed by a later slow phase of learning. How cortical plasticity emerges during these phases is unknown. Here, we examine motor map topography and synapse number within rat motor cortex during the early and late phases of motor learning. Adult rats were placed in either a skilled or unskilled reaching condition (SRC and URC, respectively) for 3, 7, or 10 d. Intracortical microstimulation of layer V was used to determine the topography of forelimb movement representations within caudal forelimb area of motor cortex contralateral to the trained paw. Quantitative electron microscopy was used to measure the number of synapses per neuron within layer V. SRC animals showed significant increases in reaching accuracy after 3, 7, and 10 d of training. In comparison with URC animals, SRC animals had significantly larger distal forelimb representations after 10 d of training only. Furthermore, SRC animals had significantly more synapses per neuron than URC animals after 7 and 10 d of training. These results show that both motor map reorganization and synapse formation occur during the late phase of skill learning. Furthermore, synaptogenesis precedes map reorganization. We propose that motor map reorganization and synapse formation do not contribute to the initial acquisition of motor skills but represent the consolidation of motor skill that occurs during late stages of training.},

These include adaptation, an internal-model based process that reduces sensory-prediction errors in order to return performance to pre-perturbation levels, use-dependent plasticity, and operant reinforcement. Visuomotor rotation and force-field tasks impose systematic errors and thereby emphasize adaptation. In skill learning tasks, which for the most part do not involve a perturbation, improved performance is manifest as reduced motor variability and probably depends less on adaptation and more on success-based exploration. Explicit awareness and declarative memory contribute, to varying degrees, to motor learning. The modularity of motor learning processes maps, at least to some extent, onto distinct brain structures.},

Perceptual learning optimizes the representations of important sensory stimuli. Associative learning and the initial phase of motor skill learning are ensured by feedback-based mechanisms that permit trial-and-error learning. The later phase of motor skill learning may primarily involve feedback-independent mechanisms operating under the classic Hebbian rule.

We found that temporally precise photoinhibition of somatosensory cortex (S1) applied concurrently with the force field abolished the ability to update subsequent motor commands needed to~reduce motor errors. This S1 photoinhibition did not impair basic motor patterns, post-perturbation completion of the action, or their performance in a reward-based learning task. Moreover, S1 photoinhibition after partial adaptation blocked further adaptation, but did not affect the expression of already-adapted motor commands. Thus, S1 is critically involved in updating the memory about the perturbation that is essential for forelimb motor adaptation.},

We set up a conflict between implicit and explicit processes by instructing subjects to counter a visuomotor rotation using a cognitive strategy in a pointing task. Specifically, they were told the exact nature of the directional perturbation, a rotation that directed them 45\textdegree{} counterclockwise from the desired target, and they were instructed to counter it by aiming for the neighboring clockwise target, 45\textdegree{} away. Subjects were initially successful in completely negating the rotation with this strategy. Surprisingly, however, they were unable to sustain explicit control and made increasingly large errors to the desired target. The cognitive strategy failed because subjects simultaneously adapted unconsciously to the rotation to the neighboring target. Notably, the rate of implicit adaptation to the neighboring target was not significantly different from rotation adaptation in the absence of an opposing explicit strategy. These results indicate that explicit strategies cannot substitute for implicit adaptation to a visuomotor rotation and are in fact overridden by the motor planning system. This suggests that the motor system requires that planned and executed trajectories remain congruous in visual space, and enforces this correspondence even at the expense of an opposing explicit task goal.},

Recent evidence supports the subdivision of sensorimotor learning into explicit and implicit processes that simultaneously subserve task performance (Taylor et al., 2014). We set out to test whether these two accounts of learning processes are homologous. Using a recently developed method to assay explicit and implicit learning directly in a sensorimotor task, along with a computational modeling analysis, we show that the fast process closely resembles explicit learning and the slow process approximates implicit learning. In addition, we provide evidence for a subdivision of the slow/implicit process into distinct manifestations of motor memory. We conclude that the two-state model of motor learning is a close approximation of sensorimotor learning, but it is unable to describe adequately the various implicit learning operations that forge the learning curve.

While recent lesion and inactivation experiments have provided hints about how various brain areas might contribute to such learning, their precise roles and the neural mechanisms underlying them are not well understood. In this work, we propose neural- and circuit-level mechanisms by which motor cortex, thalamus, and striatum support such learning. In this model, the combination of fast cortical learning and slow subcortical learning gives rise to a covert learning process through which control of behavior is gradually transferred from cortical to subcortical circuits, while protecting learned behaviors that are practiced repeatedly against overwriting by future learning. Together, these results point to a new computational role for thalamus in motor learning, and, more broadly, provide a framework for understanding the neural basis of habit formation and the automatization of behavior through practice.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Robust locomotion is critical to many species' survival, yet the mechanisms by which efficient locomotion is learned and maintained are poorly understood. In mice, a common paradigm for assaying locomotor learning is the rotarod task, in which mice learn to maintain balance atop of an accelerating rod. However, the standard metric for learning in this task is improvements in latency to fall, which gives little insight into the rich kinematic adjustments that accompany locomotor learning. In this study, we developed a rotarod-like task called the RotaWheel in which changes in paw kinematics are tracked using high-speed cameras as mice learn to stay atop an accelerating wheel. Using this device, we found that learning was accompanied by stereotyped progressions of paw kinematics that correlated with early, intermediate, and late stages of performance. Within the first day, mice sharpened their interlimb coordination using a timed pause in the forward swing of their forepaws. Over the next several days, mice reduced their stride length and took shorter, quicker steps. By the second week of training, mice began to use a more variable locomotor strategy, where consecutive overshoots or undershoots in strides were selected across paws to drive forward and backward exploration of the wheel. Collectively, our results suggest that mouse locomotor learning occurs through multiple mechanisms evolving over separate time courses and involving distinct corrective actions. These data provide insights into the kinematic strategies that accompany locomotor learning and establish an experimental platform for studying locomotor skill learning in mice.},

  abstract = {The kinematics of straight reaching movements can be specified vectorially by the direction of the movement and its extent. To explore the representation in the brain of these two properties, psychophysical studies have examined learning of visuomotor transformations of either rotation or gain and their generalization. However, the neuronal substrates of such complex learning are only beginning to be addressed. As an initial step in ensuring the validity of such investigations, it must be shown that monkeys indeed learn and generalize visuomotor transformations in the same manner as humans. Here, we analyze trajectories and velocities of movements as monkeys adapt to either rotational or gain transformations. We used rotations with different signs and magnitudes, and gains with different signs, and analyzed transfer of learning to untrained movements. The results show that monkeys can adapt to both types of transformation with a time course that resembles human learning. Analysis of the aftereffects reveals that rotation is learned locally and generalizes poorly to untrained directions, whereas gain is learned more globally and can be transferred to other amplitudes. The results lend additional support to the hypothesis that reaching movements are learned locally but can be easily rescaled to other magnitudes by scaling the peak velocity. The findings also indicate that reaching movements in monkeys are planned and executed very similarly to those in humans. This validates the underlying presumption that neuronal recordings in primates can help elucidate the mechanisms of motor learning in particular and motor planning in general.},

We tested cortico-cortical models relating the activity of hundreds of neurons in the premotor (PMd) and primary motor (M1) cortices throughout adaptation to reaching movement perturbations. We found a signature of learning in the ``output-null'' subspace of PMd with respect to M1 reflecting the ability of premotor cortex to alter preparatory activity without directly influencing M1. The output-null subspace planning activity evolved with adaptation, yet the ``output-potent'' mapping that captures information sent to M1 was preserved. Our results illustrate a population-level cortical mechanism to progressively adjust the output from one brain area to its downstream structures that could be exploited for rapid behavioral adaptation.},

Motor areas of cerebral neocortex are thought to be involved in this type of learning, possibly by functional reorganization of cortical connections. Here we show that skill learning is accompanied by changes in the strength of connections within adult rat primary motor cortex (M1). Rats were trained for three or five days in a skilled reaching task with one forelimb, after which slices of motor cortex were examined to determine the effect of training on the strength of horizontal intracortical connections in layer II/III. The amplitude of field potentials in the forelimb region contralateral to the trained limb was significantly increased relative to the opposite 'untrained' hemisphere. No differences were seen in the hindlimb region. Moreover, the amount of long-term potentiation (LTP) that could be induced in trained M1 was less than in controls, suggesting that the effect of training was at least partly due to LTP-like mechanisms. These data represent the first direct evidence that plasticity of intracortical connections is associated with learning a new motor skill.},

  abstract = {In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that a number of learning processes are at play in visuomotor adaptation tasks. In addition to implicitly adapting to a perturbation, learners can develop explicit knowledge allowing them to select better actions in responding to it. Advances in visuomotor rotation experiments have underscored the important role of such ``explicit learning'' in shaping adaptation to kinematic perturbations. Yet, in adaptation to dynamic perturbations, its contribution has been largely overlooked. We therefore sought to approach the assessment of explicit learning in adaptation to dynamic perturbations, by developing two novel modifications of a force field experiment. First, we asked learners to abandon any cognitive strategy before selected force channel trials to expose consciously accessible parts of overall learning. Here, learners indeed reduced compensatory force compared with standard Catch channels. Second, we instructed a group of learners to mimic their right hand's adaptation by moving with their na\"ive left hand. While a control group displayed negligible left hand force compensation, the mimicking group reported forces that approximated right hand adaptation but appeared to under-report the velocity component of the force field in favor of a more position-based component. Our results highlight the viability of explicit learning as a potential contributor to force field adaptation, though the fraction of learning under participants' deliberate control on average remained considerably smaller than that of implicit learning, despite task conditions favoring explicit learning. The methods we employed provide a starting point for investigating the contribution of explicit strategies to force field adaptation.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY While the contribution of explicit learning has been increasingly studied in visuomotor adaptation, its contribution to force field adaptation has not been studied extensively. We employed two novel methods to assay explicit learning in a force field adaptation task and found that learners can voluntarily control aspects of compensatory force production and manually report it with their untrained limb. This supports the general viability of the contribution of explicit learning also in force field adaptation.}

Previous literature has presented evidence of a dependency between the process of adaptation to visuomotor rotations and the constrains dictated by the workspace of the biological actuators, the muscles, and their co-activation strategies, modeled using muscle synergies analysis. To better understand this relationship, we asked a sample of healthy individuals (N = 7) to perform two experiments aiming at characterizing the adaptation to visuomotor rotations in terms of rotations of the activation space of the muscle synergies during isometric reaching tasks. In both experiments, subjects were asked to adapt to visual rotations altering the position mapping between the force exerted on a fixed manipulandum and the movement of a cursor on a screen. In the first experiment subjects adapted to three different visuomotor rotation angles (30\textdegree, 40\textdegree, and 50\textdegree{} clockwise) applied to the whole experimental workspace. In the second experiment subjects adapted to a single visuomotor rotation angle (45\textdegree{} clockwise) applied to eight different sub-spaces of the whole workspace, while also performing movements in the rest of the unperturbed workspace. The results from the first experiment confirmed the hypothesis that visuomotor rotations induce rotations in the synergies activation workspace that are proportional to the visuomotor rotation angle. The results from the second experiment showed that rotations affecting limited sub-spaces of the whole workspace are adapted for by rotating only the synergies involved in the movement, with an angle proportional to the distance between the preferred angle of the synergy and the sub-space covered by the rotation. Moreover, we show that the activation of a synergy is only rotated when the sub-space covered by the visual perturbation is applied at the boundaries of the workspace of the synergy. We found these results to be consistent across subjects, synergies and sub-spaces. Moreover, we found a correlation between synergies and muscle rotations further confirming that the adaptation process can be well described, at the neuromuscular level, using the muscle synergies model. These results provide information on how visuomotor rotations can be used to induce a desired neuromuscular response.}

  abstract = {We investigated how the CNS learns to control movements in different dynamical conditions, and how this learned behavior is represented. In particular, we considered the task of making reaching movements in the presence of externally imposed forces from a mechanical environment. This environment was a force field produced by a robot manipulandum, and the subjects made reaching movements while holding the end-effector of this manipulandum. Since the force field significantly changed the dynamics of the task, subjects' initial movements in the force field were grossly distorted compared to their movements in free space. However, with practice, hand trajectories in the force field converged to a path very similar to that observed in free space. This indicated that for reaching movements, there was a kinematic plan independent of dynamical conditions. The recovery of performance within the changed mechanical environment is motor adaptation. In order to investigate the mechanism underlying this adaptation, we considered the response to the sudden removal of the field after a training phase. The resulting trajectories, named aftereffects, were approximately mirror images of those that were observed when the subjects were initially exposed to the field. This suggested that the motor controller was gradually composing a model of the force field, a model that the nervous system used to predict and compensate for the forces imposed by the environment. In order to explore the structure of the model, we investigated whether adaptation to a force field, as presented in a small region, led to aftereffects in other regions of the workspace. We found that indeed there were aftereffects in workspace regions where no exposure to the field had taken place; that is, there was transfer beyond the boundary of the training data. This observation rules out the hypothesis that the subject's model of the force field was constructed as a narrow association between visited states and experienced forces; that is, adaptation was not via composition of a look-up table. In contrast, subjects modeled the force field by a combination of computational elements whose output was broadly tuned across the motor state space. These elements formed a model that extrapolated to outside the training region in a coordinate system similar to that of the joints and muscles rather than end-point forces. This geometric property suggests that the elements of the adaptive process represent dynamics of a motor task in terms of the intrinsic coordinate system of the sensors and actuators.},

A solution is to build adaptive internal models of the body and the world. The predictions of these internal models, called forward models because they transform motor commands into sensory consequences, can be used to both produce a lifetime of calibrated movements, and to improve the ability of the sensory system to estimate the state of the body and the world around it. Forward models are only useful if they produce unbiased predictions. Evidence shows that forward models remain calibrated through motor adaptation: learning driven by sensory prediction errors.},

One process responds weakly to error but retains information well, whereas the other responds strongly but has poor retention. This two-state learning system makes the surprising prediction of spontaneous recovery (or adaptation rebound) if error feedback is clamped at zero following an adaptation-extinction training episode. We used a novel paradigm to experimentally confirm this prediction in human motor learning of reaching, and we show that the interaction between the learning processes in this simple two-state system provides a unifying explanation for several different, apparently unrelated, phenomena in motor adaptation including savings, anterograde interference, spontaneous recovery, and rapid unlearning. Our results suggest that motor adaptation depends on at least two distinct neural systems that have different sensitivity to error and retain information at different rates.},

In this paper we question this view of motor skill. We begin by situating the notion of skill in historical and philosophical context. We use the discussion to explain and motivate the view that motor skill depends upon knowledge of facts. This conclusion seemingly contradicts well-known results in cognitive science. It is natural, on the face of it, to take the case of H.M., the seminal case in cognitive neuroscience that led to the discovery of different memory systems, as providing powerful evidence for the independence of knowledge and skill acquisition. After all, H.M. seems to show that motor learning is retained even when previous knowledge about the activity has been lost. Improvements in skill generally require increased precision of selected actions, what we call motor acuity. Motor acuity may indeed not require propositional knowledge and has direct parallels with perceptual acuity. We argue, however, that reflection on the specifics of H.M.'s case, as well as other research on the nature of skill, indicates that learning to become skilled at a motor task, for example, tennis depends also on knowledge-based selection of the right actions. Thus skilled activity requires both acuity and knowledge, with both increasing with practice. The moral of our discussion ranges beyond debates about motor skill; we argue that it undermines any attempt to draw a distinction between practical and theoretical activities. While we will reject the independence of skill and knowledge, our discussion leaves open several different possible relations between knowledge and skill. Deciding between them is a task to be resolved by future research.},

Previous psychophysical studies have concluded that postadaptation generalization is restricted to a narrow range of directions around the training direction. A population-coding model that updates the weights between narrow Gaussian-tuned visual units and motor units on each trial reproduced experimental trial-by-trial learning curves for rotation adaptation and the generalization function measured postadaptation. These results suggest that the neurons involved in rotation adaptation have a relatively narrow directional tuning width ({$\sim$}23\textdegree ). Population coding models with units having broader tuning functions (such as cosine tuning in motor cortex and Gaussian sum in the cerebellum) could not reproduce the narrow single-peaked generalization pattern. Visually selective neurons with narrow Gaussian tuning curves have been identified in posterior parietal cortex, making it a possible site of adaptation to visuomotor rotation. We propose that rotation adaptation proceeds through changes in synaptic weights between neurons in posterior parietal cortex and motor cortex driven by a prediction error computed by the cerebellum.}

The combination of new behavioral methods and computational methods has begun to unravel the interaction between processes related to strategic control and processes related to motor adaptation. These processes may operate on very different error signals. Strategy learning is sensitive to goal-based performance error. In contrast, adaptation is sensitive to prediction errors between the desired and actual consequences of a planned movement. The former guides what the desired movement should be, whereas the latter guides how to implement the desired movement. Whereas traditional approaches have favored serial models in which an initial strategy-based phase gives way to more automatized forms of control, it now seems that strategic and adaptive processes operate with considerable independence throughout learning, although the relative weight given the two processes will shift with changes in performance. As such, skill acquisition involves the synergistic engagement of strategic and adaptive processes.},

A striking feature of human competence is the ability to receive verbal instructions and employ strategies to solve tasks; such explicit processes could be used during visuomotor adaptation. Here, we used a novel task design that allowed us to obtain continuous verbal reports of aiming direction while participants learned a visuomotor rotation. We had two main hypotheses: the contribution of explicit learning would be modulated by instruction and the contribution of implicit learning would be modulated by the form of error feedback. By directly assaying aiming direction, we could identify the time course of the explicit component and, via subtraction, isolate the implicit component of learning. There were marked differences in the time courses of explicit and implicit contributions to learning. Explicit learning, driven by target error, was achieved by initially large then smaller explorations of aiming direction biased toward the correct solution. In contrast, implicit learning, driven by a sensory-prediction error, was slow and monotonic. Continuous error feedback reduced the amplitude of explicit learning and increased the contribution of implicit learning. The presence of instruction slightly increased the rate of initial learning and only had a subtle effect on implicit learning. We conclude that visuomotor adaptation, even in the absence of instruction, results from the interplay between explicit learning driven by target error and implicit learning of a forward model driven by prediction error.},

  abstract = {The search for the neural substrates mediating the incremental acquisition of skilled motor behaviors has been the focus of a large body of animal and human studies in the past decade. Much less is known, however, with regard to the dynamic neural changes that occur in the motor system during the different phases of learning. In this paper, we review recent findings, mainly from our own work using fMRI, which suggest that: (i) the learning of sequential finger movements produces a slowly evolving reorganization within primary motor cortex (M1) over the course of weeks and (ii) this change in M1 follows more dynamic, rapid changes in the cerebellum, striatum, and other motor-related cortical areas over the course of days. We also briefly review neurophysiological and psychophysical evidence for the consolidation of motor skills, and we propose a working hypothesis of its underlying neural substrate in motor sequence learning.},

  abstract = {Current theories suggest that an error-driven learning process updates trial-by-trial to facilitate motor adaptation. How this process interacts with motor cortical preparatory activity\textemdash which current models suggest plays a critical role in movement initiation\textemdash remains unknown. Here, we evaluated the role of motor preparation during visuomotor adaptation. We found that preparation time was inversely correlated to variance of errors on current trials and mean error on subsequent trials. We also found causal evidence that intracortical microstimulation during motor preparation was sufficient to disrupt learning. Surprisingly, stimulation did not affect current trials, but instead disrupted the update computation of a learning process, thereby affecting subsequent trials. This is consistent with a Bayesian estimation framework where the motor system reduces its learning rate by virtue of lowering error sensitivity when faced with uncertainty. This interaction between motor preparation and the error-driven learning system may facilitate new probes into mechanisms underlying trial-by-trial adaptation.},
