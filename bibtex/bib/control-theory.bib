  abstract = {This paper concerns the stability optimization of (parameterized) matrices \$A(x)\$, a problem typically arising in the design of fixed-order or fixed-structured feedback controllers. It is well known that the minimization of the spectral abscissa function \$\textbackslash{}alpha(A)\$ gives rise to very difficult optimization problems, since \$\textbackslash{}alpha(A)\$ is not everywhere differentiable and even not everywhere Lipschitz. We therefore propose a new stability measure, namely, the smoothed spectral abscissa \$\textbackslash{}tilde\textbackslash{}alpha\_\{\textbackslash{}epsilon\}(A)\$, which is based on the inversion of a relaxed \$H\_2\$-type cost function. The regularization parameter \$\textbackslash{}epsilon\$ allows tuning the degree of smoothness. For \$\textbackslash{}epsilon\$ approaching zero, the smoothed spectral abscissa converges towards the nonsmooth spectral abscissa from above so that \$\textbackslash{}tilde\textbackslash{}alpha\_\{\textbackslash{}epsilon\}(A)\textbackslash{}leq0\$ guarantees asymptotic stability. Evaluation of the smoothed spectral abscissa and its derivatives w.r.t. matrix parameters x can be performed at the cost of solving a primal-dual Lyapunov equation pair, allowing for an efficient integration into a derivative-based optimization framework. Two optimization problems are considered: On the one hand, the minimization of the smoothed spectral abscissa \$\textbackslash{}tilde\textbackslash{}alpha\_\{\textbackslash{}epsilon\}(A(x))\$ as a function of the matrix parameters for a fixed value of \$\textbackslash{}epsilon\$, and, on the other hand, the maximization of \$\textbackslash{}epsilon\$ such that the stability requirement \$\textbackslash{}tilde\textbackslash{}alpha\_\{\textbackslash{}epsilon\}(A(x))\textbackslash{}leq0\$ is still satisfied. The latter problem can be interpreted as an \$H\_2\$-norm minimization problem, and its solution additionally implies an upper bound on the corresponding \$H\_\textbackslash{}infty\$-norm or a lower bound on the distance to instability. In both cases, additional equality and inequality constraints on the variables can be naturally taken into account in the optimization problem.},
