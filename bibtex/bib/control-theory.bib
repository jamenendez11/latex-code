  abstract = {This paper concerns the stability optimization of (parameterized) matrices \$A(x)\$, a problem typically arising in the design of fixed-order or fixed-structured feedback controllers. It is well known that the minimization of the spectral abscissa function \$\textbackslash alpha(A)\$ gives rise to very difficult optimization problems, since \$\textbackslash alpha(A)\$ is not everywhere differentiable and even not everywhere Lipschitz. We therefore propose a new stability measure, namely, the smoothed spectral abscissa \$\textbackslash tilde\textbackslash alpha\_\{\textbackslash epsilon\}(A)\$, which is based on the inversion of a relaxed \$H\_2\$-type cost function. The regularization parameter \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ allows tuning the degree of smoothness. For \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ approaching zero, the smoothed spectral abscissa converges towards the nonsmooth spectral abscissa from above so that \$\textbackslash tilde\textbackslash alpha\_\{\textbackslash epsilon\}(A)\textbackslash leq0\$ guarantees asymptotic stability. Evaluation of the smoothed spectral abscissa and its derivatives w.r.t. matrix parameters x can be performed at the cost of solving a primal-dual Lyapunov equation pair, allowing for an efficient integration into a derivative-based optimization framework. Two optimization problems are considered: On the one hand, the minimization of the smoothed spectral abscissa \$\textbackslash tilde\textbackslash alpha\_\{\textbackslash epsilon\}(A(x))\$ as a function of the matrix parameters for a fixed value of \$\textbackslash epsilon\$, and, on the other hand, the maximization of \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ such that the stability requirement \$\textbackslash tilde\textbackslash alpha\_\{\textbackslash epsilon\}(A(x))\textbackslash leq0\$ is still satisfied. The latter problem can be interpreted as an \$H\_2\$-norm minimization problem, and its solution additionally implies an upper bound on the corresponding \$H\_\textbackslash infty\$-norm or a lower bound on the distance to instability. In both cases, additional equality and inequality constraints on the variables can be naturally taken into account in the optimization problem.}

As an application of this result, it is shown that an open-loop system can be stabilized by linear feedback if and only if the unstable modes of its system matrix are controllable. A dual of this criterion is shown to be equivalent to the existence of an observer of Luenberger's type for asymptotic state identification.},
