  abstract = {A class of well-known canonical forms for single-input or single-output controllable and observable systems are extended to multivariable systems. It is shown that, unlike the single-variable case, the canonical forms are generally not unique, but that the structure of the canonical form can be controlled to some extent by the designer. A major result of the paper is that a multi-input system can be transformed to a set of coupled single-input subsystems.},

As an application of this result, it is shown that an open-loop system can be stabilized by linear feedback if and only if the unstable modes of its system matrix are controllable. A dual of this criterion is shown to be equivalent to the existence of an observer of Luenberger's type for asymptotic state identification.},
